Here is a new README tailored to your project "MaskBook" using Svelte and Go.

# 🎭 MaskBook

> An Indian parody of Facebook. (Because showing your real face is *so* last season.)

Welcome to **MaskBook** – the only social network where everyone is "living their best life," and every post is 100% *sanskari* (even when it's not). This is a satirical project about the "social mask" we all wear, viewed through a *desi* lens.

It's the digital *Chaupal* (village square) where you put on your best *Mukhauta* (mask) to share news, gossip, and unsolicited *gyaan*.

## 🤔 What's the *Natak*?

We all know the "social" part of social media is a performance. MaskBook leans into that.

  * Why just "like" a post when you can give a **"Nazar Na Lage 🧿"** reaction?
  * Why have a "profile" when you can have a **"Mukhauta"** that only shows your good side?
  * Why "unfriend" relatives when you can just "Politely Ignore" them forever?

MaskBook is the *asli* (real) face of our online lives.

## ✨ Features (The *Asli Maal*)

We've re-engineered your favorite features for maximum *dikhava* (show-off):

  * **👤 The *Mukhauta* (Profile Page):** Forget "About Me." Your profile shows what *really* matters:
      * "Perfect Family" photo (mandatory).
      * A list of "Foreign Trips" (real or Photoshopped).
      * Your "Sharmaji's Kid" comparison score.
  * **📰 The *Chaupal* (News Feed):** A curated feed of things everyone *must* see:
      * Pixelated "Good Morning" rose images from your *Fufaji*.
      * Photos of food from a 5-star hotel (even if you just had *dal chawal*).
      * Vague, philosophical quotes about "haters."
  * **👍 Reactions (Now with more *Bhaavna*\!):**
      * **Hawww\!:** For all the low-key scandals.
      * **Badhaai Ho\! (Congrats\!):** For new car/house/baby announcements.
      * **Nazar Na Lage 🧿:** The official evil-eye protection for baby photos.
      * **Sab Changa Si (All is Well):** A reaction for pretending everything is fine.
  * **👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 *Jaan-Pehchaan* (Friends List):**
      * You can't "block" anyone from your extended family. The button is disabled.
      * "Friend Requests" are replaced by **"*Rishta* Suggestions"** from your parents' accounts.
  * **👉 The *Ishara* (The "Poke" 2.0):**
      * A subtle, passive-aggressive way to get someone's attention.
      * Sends a notification: "Pinky Aunty gave you an *Ishara*. You know what for."

## 🛠️ Tech Stack (How the *Jugaad* Works)

This marvel of engineering is built with a stack that's as fast as neighbourhood gossip.

  * **Frontend (The shiny *Mukhauta*):** **Svelte**
      * *Why?* Because it's blazing fast, with no virtual DOM. It compiles away, leaving just a perfect, polished performance.
  * **Backend (The *Asli Chehra*):** **Go (Golang)**
      * *Why?* It's concurrent, strictly typed, and incredibly efficient. Perfect for handling millions of "Good Morning" messages at scale.
  * **Database:** MongoDB (To store all the *panchayat*)

## 🚀 Getting Started (Run your own *Mandali*)

Want to run this *tamasha* on your local machine?

1.  **Clone the repo:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/maskbook.git
    cd maskbook
    ```

2.  **Start the Backend (Go):**

    ```bash
    cd server
    ```

      * Create a `.env` file and add your variables:
        ```env
        PORT = "8080"
        MONGO_URI = "your_mongodb_connection_string"
        JWT_SECRET = "a_secret_safer_than_your_family_recipes"
        ```
      * Install dependencies and run:
        ```bash
        go mod tidy  # Fetches dependencies
        go run main.go
        ```
      * Your Go backend is now running on `http://localhost:8080`

3.  **Start the Frontend (Svelte):**

    ```bash
    cd ../frontend  # Go back to root and into client
    npm install
    npm run dev
    ```

      * Your Svelte app is now running, probably on `http://localhost:5173`.

4.  Open your browser to the Svelte app's URL and start the *bakar*\!

### 💡 Ideas We Need Help With:

  * A **"Sanskari Filter"** using AI to automatically cover up knees and shoulders in photos.
  * An **"Arrange Marriage"** integration with `Shaadi.com` (as a "Networking" feature).
  * A "Log in with OTP" that *also* sends the OTP to your parents' number "for security."
